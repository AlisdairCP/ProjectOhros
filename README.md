## Premise:
A 2D action-adventure game held in the dystopian city of Araphel. You take control of Lila, a beautiful yet dangerous witch stranded in the heart of the metropolis after an accident with her broomstick. She now has to rely on her powers and wits to escape to the outside world, Ohros. However, her situation has an unexpected escalation when she is followed by a looming shadow.... 

## Characters:

### Lila:
A young witch who resides beyond Araphel, part of a secret clan somewhere in Ohros. It is said that flying your broom in the most fierce of storms is a sign of bravery and beauty among the witches; especially those who have recently turned 18. Not one to show herself as afraid, Lila took off into the skies when rumour buzzed that a storm had fork lightning which damaged the roof of the local pub. Sure enough, she flew too close to the lightning strikes and her broom snapped in two! The next thing she knew; she had a nasty fall into the city, with all her spell charges scattered across the streets. Now, armed with only her staff, she is trying to find her way back to the outside world. She is something of a tomboy, always keeping a brave face to hide her fears amidst the danger. As she encounters a large, looming shadow, it becomes more difficult for her to keep up her mindset.


## Setting:
The game takes place in the far distant future, where some humans have developed to the point where they can use magic. Governments across the world fear this power; prompting a global ban which has forced the gifted to live outside of civilisation. The metropolitan areas are now heavily guarded, with humans and machines alike being given the task to prevent outsiders from entering. Araphel is among the mightiest, where weapon and machine production has caused widespread pollution. To witches like Lila, the few areas they can call home outside of these cities have become collectively known as Ohros.  


## Gameplay:
The game is an action-adventure game using a 2D format. The player takes control of Lila, a witch who is capable of both melee and magic abilities. These are to be used in both combat and adventure sections.

### Moveset:

#### Staff thrust:
A melee attack where Lila thrusts her staff towards the enemy. Due to its magical properties, it is able to wipe out a human in a single touch.

#### Staff spin:
If Lila holds her Staff thrust attack, she will conjure a blade. When charged up, the blade will perform a powerful spin attack.

#### Spells:
Lila can retrieve her spell charges as pickups scattered across the streets of Araphel. These allow her to perform ranged attacks which inflict much greater damage than her staff, though they cost a spell charge per use.

### Enemies:

#### Agents:
- Health: 1
- Damage: 1
- Speed: 48
- Drop: Heart

Human opponents that have been hired by the government to exterminate any mages that appear in the city.

#### Robots:
- Health: 3
- Damage: 3
- Speed: 36
- Drop: Spell

Robots built to dispose of criminals of all kinds. Were designed to withstand magic and deal greater damager than the agents, though they move much slower. Though they can take a beating from a staff, they're as vulnerable to a big bang as anything else!
