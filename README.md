## About:
OpenJam 2022 game. Collaboration between AlisdairCP and OliverStuP.

## Premise:
A 2D action-adventure game taking place in the dystopian city of Araphel. You take control of Lila, a witch whose broomstick crash landed into the heart of the metropolis. Now; she is using her powers to escape to the outside world, Ohros. However, the situation begins to go southward when she is followed by a looming shadow. 

## Characters:

### Lila:
A young witch who resides outside of Araphel, part of a secret clan somewhere in Ohros. While travelling on her broomstick; an unexpected storm caused her ride to snap, causing her to fall into the city. Now, armed with only her spellcasting prowess, she is trying to find her way back to the outside world. She is something of a tomboy, trying to keep a brave face to hide her fears amidst the danger. As she encounters a large, looming shadow, it becomes more difficult for her to keep up her mindset.


## Setting:
The game takes place in the far distant future, where some humans have developed to the point where they can use magic. Governments across the world fear this power; prompting a widespread ban, forcing those who are gifted to live outside of civilisation. The metropolitan areas are now heavily guarded, with humans and machines alike being given the task to prevent outsiders from prospering. One of the largest and most heavily armed is Araphel, where weapon and machine production has caused pollution to spread throughout. To witches such as Lila, who are not welcome, the few areas outside of these cities has become collectively known as Ohros.
